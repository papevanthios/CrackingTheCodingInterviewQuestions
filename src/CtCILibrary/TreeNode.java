/**
 * The TreeNode program implemented in Java for learning purposes.
 *
 * While it's perfectly fine - even good - to use the built-in binary tree class when possible, it's not always
 * possible. In many questions, we needed access to the internals of the node or tree class (or needed to tweak these)
 * and thus couldn't use the built-in libraries.
 *
 * The TreeNode class supports a variety of functionality, much of which we wouldn't necessarily want for every
 * question/solution. For example, the TreeNode class tracks the parent of the node, even though we often don't use it
 * (or specifically ban using it).
 *
 * The tree is implemented to be a binary search tree. However, you can use it for other purposes. You would just need
 * to use the setLeftChild/setRightChild methods, or the left and right child variables. For this reason, we have kept
 * these methods and variable public. We need this sort of access for many problems.
